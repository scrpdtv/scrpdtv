# Hey, I'm ScrapedTV

I code stuff. Mainly Minecraft plugins, bots, and whatever else sounds interesting.

Been programming for a while now and I'm pretty good at making things work. If you need something built, I probably know how to do it.

## What I actually do

**Minecraft stuff:**
- Custom plugins (Spigot/Paper/Bukkit)
- Server networks and infrastructure
- Performance optimization
- Economy systems, minigames, all that
- Bots for farming, moderation, whatever you need

**Other stuff:**
- Discord bots
- Web scraping
- Backend development
- Automation scripts
- Database work

## Current projects

Working on a few things right now:
- Advanced minigame framework
- Discord bot with some AI features
- Server analytics dashboard
- Some automation tools

Most of my repos are private but I push the good stuff public when it's ready.

## Commissions

Yeah, I take commissions. Need a plugin, bot, or pretty much anything coded? Hit me up.
