Welcome to my digital playground! I'm a passionate developer who specializes in **Minecraft plugin development**, **bot creation**, and building cutting-edge applications. From crafting custom Minecraft servers to automating complex workflows – I turn ideas into reality.

> 💡 *"Code is poetry written in logic."*  
> 🎮 *"Why play Minecraft when you can reprogram it?"*  
> 🤖 *"If it's repetitive, I'll automate it. If it's broken, I'll fix it. If it doesn't exist, I'll build it."*

## 🎯 What I'm Good At

**Game Development:**
- Custom Minecraft plugins from scratch
- Performance optimization - making servers run smooth
- Multi-server networks that actually work
- Database integration - persistent data done right
- Custom APIs - because sometimes Spigot isn't enough

**Automation & Bots:**
- Discord bots that don't crash every 5 minutes
- Minecraft bots for literally anything
- Web scrapers that get the job done
- Task automation - if you do it twice, automate it
- AI integration - making bots actually smart

---

## 💡 My Approach

**Mindset:** If it exists, I can make it better. If it doesn't exist, I'll build it.

**Code Philosophy:** Clean, efficient, and doesn't break at 3 AM

**Motto:** Automate the boring stuff, build the cool stuff

**Goal:** Create tools that actually solve problems
